Task-1:

Dear Client,
we have conducted a data quality assesment of the datasets you have provided us with. 
The three data sets("Transactions" "CustomerDemographic" "CustomerAddress") are combined to form a larger
dataset of your customers information and thir corresponding transactions. Note this reduces the number of 
customers by 3 due to inner join.

Here is a breief report.
The dataset has 19968 rows or transactions and 30 columns. There are 3489 customers

1) There are some missing values in the following columns. The number of missing values per cloumn is shown below.

online_order             :  359
brand                    :  195
product_line             :  195
product_class            :  195
product_size             :  195
standard_cost            :  195
product_first_sold_date  :  195
last_name                :  642
DOB                      :  446
job_title                :  2379
job_industry_category    :  3222
default                  :  1451
tenure                   :  446

2) The column "product_first_sold_date" has values that cannot be interpreted as a date. Example values
are 41245.0	,37659.0 etc.

3) The column gender represents the gender class with different notations like females are given values as "F"
"Femal" and "Female". similarly males are "M", "Male". This has to be corrected by using same value for a iven gender.

4) The column "default" has many absurb values

5) The column country has zero variance and is not usefull for analysis

6) The customer with customer_id = 34 was born in the year 1843. This is absurd
